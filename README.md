1. Problem Statement
Objective: The primary goal of this project, DreamScope: Unveiling Sleep Patterns and Predictors, is to understand how various synthetic health and sleep metrics influence sleep quality and to develop predictive models to estimate sleep quality based on these metrics. Additionally, the project aims to uncover deeper insights through advanced analyses and provide actionable recommendations for improving sleep health.

Dataset Overview: The dataset includes synthetic measurements on several health and sleep-related factors:

Heart Rate Variability: Variability in time intervals between heartbeats.
Body Temperature: Body temperature in degrees Celsius.
Movement During Sleep: Amount of movement while sleeping.
Sleep Duration Hours: Total hours of sleep.
Sleep Quality Score: Score representing the quality of sleep.
Caffeine Intake (mg): Amount of caffeine consumption.
Stress Level: Index of stress levels.
Bedtime Consistency: Consistency of bedtime routine on a 0-1 scale.
Light Exposure Hours: Hours of light exposure during the day.
2. Objectives
Predict Sleep Quality: Develop predictive models to estimate the Sleep Quality Score using other metrics.
Feature Analysis: Identify significant features impacting sleep quality and engineer new features for better model performance.
Model Evaluation: Compare various machine learning models to find the best fit for predicting sleep quality.
Clustering Patterns: Discover potential patterns or clusters in the data that may reveal insights into different sleep profiles.
Time Series Insights: Analyze how sleep quality varies over time if temporal data is available.
Correlation Analysis: Examine correlations between features to understand their relationships and impacts.
Interactive Visualization: Create dashboards for interactive exploration of the dataset.
